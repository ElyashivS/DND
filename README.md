# DND

In this assignment you will implement a single-player multi-level version of a dungeons and dragons board game. You are trapped in a dungeon, surrounded by enemies. Your goal is to fight your way through them and get to the next level of the dungeon. Once you complete all the levels, you win the game. The program will be checked for correctness, complying to OOP principles and coding conventions.

There is 2 main layers in this project.
The Presentation layer (view and controller): Where the class "gameManger" is.
And the Buisness layer (model): Where all the rest of the classes are.
